## Omicron

<!-- Whisper is a minimal documentation theme for Hugo. The design and functionality is intentionally minimal. Weâ€™re aiming for a similar feel to a Github readme. -->
Omicron is a framework for the development of intelligent agents. 

This site is still a work in progress and will continually be updated. This is where the documentation for all Omicron Projects will be.

The following projects are part of the Omicron Framework: 
  - **Omicron** - an agent development library
  - **Omnigraph** - an agent memory graph
  - **Delta Protocol** - a protocol for the sharing and access of data among services
